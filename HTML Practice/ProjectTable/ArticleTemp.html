        <p contenteditable="true">Search giant Google on Wednesday celebrated 'Pani Puri', the much-loved Indian street snack, 
            by introducing an interactive doodle game around it.<br> It was on this day in 2015 that a restaurant
             in Madhya Pradesh's Indore achieved the World Record for serving the most flavours of 'Pani Puri' 
             by offering 51 options, under the guidance of Masterchef Neha Shah. <br>Pani Puri, occupying a special 
             place in India's hearts -- and stomachs -- is a fried disc of dough commonly filled with boiled chickpeas,
            a white pea mixture, and sprouts dipped in tangy and spicy water.<br> It is famously known as 'Puchka', 
            'Golgappe' and 'Pani patashi' in different cities across the country.</p>
        <p>"Today's interactive game Doodle celebrates pani puri â€” a popular South Asian street food made of a crispy shell stuffed with potatoes, chickpeas, spices, or chilis and flavoured waters," read the Google doodle.</p>    
        <p>Though there are different varieties of filling and 'pani' to cater to everyone's unique palette, there are two things, the search engine notes, that everyone can agree on: "eat the pani puri quickly to avoid the puri getting soggy or leaking, and always eat it in one bite to avoid a crumbly mess".

            The rules of the game in the Google doodle are simple. The players are tasked with the challenge to help a street vendor team fill orders for pani puri. They have to choose the puris that match each customer's flavor and quantity preference to keep them happy.</p>
