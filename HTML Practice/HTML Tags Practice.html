        <h1><u>History Of HTML....</u></h1>
        <p>The first version of HTML was written by <mark><b> Berners-Lee</b></mark> in 1993. <br>
           Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML. <br>
            The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, 
            which became an official standard in December 1999.<br> Another version, 
            XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language.</p>
            <h2><u> Timline of HTML</u></h2>
            <p contenteditable="true">1993- HTML 1.0 is released. Not many developers are creating websites at this time.<br>
                1995- HTML 2.0 is published. This contains the features of HTML 1.0 plus new features. This remained the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until 1997.
                <br>1997- HTML 3.0 was invented. Here, Dave Raggett introduced a fresh draft on HTML, which improved new features of HTML and gave more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing websites.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unfortunately, the powerful features slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.
                <br>1999- The widely-used HTML 4.0 comes out. It is very successful.
                <br>2014- HTML 5.0 is released and used worldwide. It is said to be the extended version of HTML 4.01 which was published in 2012.
